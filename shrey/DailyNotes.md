### Task 1: Disassembling Of Particulate Matter Sensor

Today's work consisted of disassembling particulate matter (PM) sensors. There were two sections within these sensors:

- A portion containing the sensor itself (Optical Particle Counter) and an Argon Arduino Board to manage it.
- A portion containing a GPS, camera module, and the processing units

### 1.1: Processing Portion (Interior)

**Main Components:**

- G-Mouse GPS Module
- USB 3 Power Hub
- 5.0 MP USB Camera Module
- Linux Computer - Odroid XU4 - central computing unit
- PCB (Argon)
- C1+ Module (Argon) - encrypts data to be sent
- Light Sensor Module

**Dismantling Process**

1. Remove box lid
2. Remove 3D printed frame and all components from box
3. Remove USBs and Ethernet cables
4. Remove USB hub and Ethernet-USB converter
5. Remove wires attached to terminal blocks in PCB
5. Unscrew all circuit boards
6. Remove GPS module

### 1.2: Sensor Portion (Exterior)

**Main Components:**

- Steven Sunshields
- Optical Particle Counter (OPC)
- PCB (Manage OPC)

**Dismantling Process:**
1. Free wires from the lid of the interior portion
3. Unscrew and remove all steven sunshields except the base one
4. Unscrew PCB
5. Unplug all wires and cut zipties

**Homework:**
- ~~Obtain basic familiarization with github~~
- ~~Finish daily notes~~
- ~~Chapter 2 Problems of C.M. book~~
