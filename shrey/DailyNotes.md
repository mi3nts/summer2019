### Task 1: Disassembling Of Particulate Matter Sensor

Today's work consisted of dismantling of particulate matter (PM) sensors. There were two sections within these sensors:

- A portion containing the sensor itself (Optical Particle Counter) and an Argon Arduino Board to manage it.
- A portion containing a GPS, camera module, and the processing units

### 1.1: Sensor Portion

Main Components:

- Steven Sunshield - Ovular plastic pieces - These were desirable as they blocked out water and sunlight, but allowed particles to enter.
- Arduino Board (Argon)
- Optical Particle Counter (OPC)
- Wiring

### 1.2: Processing Portion

Main Components:

- G-Mouse GPS Module
- USB 3 Power Hub
- 5.0 MP USB Camera Module
- Linux Computer - Odroid XU4 - central computing unit
- Power Circuit Board (Argon)
- C1+ Module (Argon) - encrypts data to be sent
- Light Sensor Module
- Some wiring

**Work of tomorrow:** Obtain familiarization with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

**Homework for week of 6/23-6/29:**
- Learn about .json files
- Learn more about ML
- Continue Classical Mechanics Book
