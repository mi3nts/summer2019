### Task 1: Disassembling Of Particulate Matter Sensor

Today's work consisted of dismantling of particulate matter (PM) sensors. There were two sections within these sensors:

- A portion containing the sensor itself (Optical Particle Counter) and an Argon Arduino Board to manage it.
- A portion containing a GPS, camera module, and the processing units

### 1.1: Sensor Portion (Exterior)


**Main Components:**

- Steven Sunshields
- Optical Particle Counter (OPC)
- Circuit Board (Manage OPC)

**Deconstruction Process:**
1. Free wires from the lid of the interior portion
2. Unscrew washers from metal rods and slide rods out
3. Remove all steven sunshields except the base one
4. Unscrew circuit board
5. Unplug all wires and cut zipties

### 1.2: Processing Portion (Interior)

Main Components:

- G-Mouse GPS Module
- USB 3 Power Hub
- 5.0 MP USB Camera Module
- Linux Computer - Odroid XU4 - central computing unit
- Power Circuit Board (Argon)
- C1+ Module (Argon) - encrypts data to be sent
- Light Sensor Module
- Some wiring

**Work of tomorrow:** Obtain familiarization with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

**Homework for week of 6/23-6/29:**
- Learn about .json files
- Learn more about ML
- Continue Classical Mechanics Book
